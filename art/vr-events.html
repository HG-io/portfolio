This is an art and research project that was carried out during the lockdown periods of the pandemic. Twelve virtual audio-visual art events were organised. I designed the scenes and produced the visual artefacts including 3D models, videos and stills. The final scenes and assets were put together on <em>Mozilla Spoke</em> and the experiences were hosted on <em>Mozilla Hubs</em>, an accessible and open-source VR platform, which the guests could access via web browsers or HMDs.
<br><br>
In this event series that took place in 2021, I hosted an electronic music artist at each event and they were asked to <strong>"imagine a world where we are not able to dance again, what would that sound like?</strong>. The aim of this project was to gain insights on how participants interact with both the VR environment and each other in the context of virtual audio-visual art events; and whether this environment can be a better alternative to live or recorded online streams.
<br><br>
It was observed that the guests were highly engaged in these events. Their feedback included:
<br><br>
"More realistic and engaging experience compared to online streams" <br><br>
"Being able to navigate in the space freely with their avatars"<br><br>
"Experiencing spatial/3D audio like in the physical reality"<br><br>
"Interacting with others using real-time audio, video and chat-box features"
<br><br>
Below, you can see what the spaces looked like.
