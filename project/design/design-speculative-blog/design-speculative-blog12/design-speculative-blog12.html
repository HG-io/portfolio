I have to say that this has been my favourite project experience this year. I initially thought it was going to be challenging due to having to meet up remotely in a very Zoom-fatigued period. We are very different people, with very different backgrounds and experiences, which has ended up being the most interesting and stimulating aspect of this project.
<br>
<br>
In terms of the 'Smart City' concept, I have gained a much broader understanding of the topic and started seeing all the different shades in the process of design, which was very much thanks to the group discussions that promoted further thinking and research. It is obvious that smart cities can create a lot of positives like making life easier and more sustainable while it can also go really wrong in the hands of the parties that see it as a massive money-making opportunity (and it is) and make decisions without considering the effects on the society and possible negative implications and divisions in the society by tailoring the smart features for the wealthy and more privileged. Similar concerns are raised by Dunne and Raby, under the topics of 'market forces' (that design is commercialised and speculative approaches aren't tailored to contribute to wealth generation), 'atomization' (today, there is more emphasis on individual gains and achievements, designing for societal issues is not in high demand) and lastly 'pessimism' (as the dreams have turned into 'hopes' now, why bother designing for societal issues when there are such big global issues such as climate change and economic crisis?)
<br>
<br>
While we have been aware of all these challenges and the difficulty of validating a design proposal such as ours in the current marketplace; for us as a group, a smart city meant one that added to or enhanced positive values, enabled new opportunities and addressed broader issues in the society such as equality, welfare and higher quality of life for everyone, and our design process has been based on these values.
