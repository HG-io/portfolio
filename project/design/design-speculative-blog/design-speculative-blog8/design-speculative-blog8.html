The beginning of our exploration was mainly focused on "spaces/places". We talked about public spaces, as well as private ones like people's homes. After our initial meeting where we discussed potential 'settings' for implementation, we agreed to think further about this before our following meeting and to come up with ideas and visual references that could be in the form of still images such as photos, sketches, drawings, or videos accompanied by short textual notes. The following week, we organised everything on our Miro board, similar to a moodboard, then we discussed all of them. This was probably our longest session together. We marked our favourites to see which ones appealed to the majority of us.</p>

The highlight of mine were probably the 'sound domes', or 'bubbles' as some of the group have referred to them. I had two versions of them; 'smart personal pods (AI Escape Pods)' in public spaces and 'communal pods', which we later called 'community centres'.</p>

Placing functional objects in public spaces makes sense to me. They could make the implementation of sound collection easier and more flexible in terms of space, location and time as they could easily be placed in different locations where sound collection with bigger structures is not possible.
We have talked about all sorts of public 'city objects' from benches to post-boxes, traffic lights, bins, ticket machines, fences, etc; all the objects we regularly interact with or see daily and take for granted. They are mostly there to serve for a purpose and we expect them to be there.

As I mentioned in one of the previous entries, 'Broken Nature' exhibition I attended a couple of years ago was very inspirational then, making me think about design in a way I had not before, and also now during this project. Some of the objects I photographed, which have happened to be sources of inspiration in this project are:

I firstly designed a number of 3D objects including benches and street lights for reference as agreed in one of our group discussions, then I thought that we could still have objects that would serve for a purpose but they didn't have to look 'ordinary'. Then following another discussion, I designed objects to experiment with the aesthetics that could possibly encourage more interaction, hence more sound collection, such as the sculptures below that could serve as seats or random city sculptures.
<br>
<br>
In addition to all our values and priorities in this project, I personally I think that an attractive and vibrant public space would also mean more engagement, therefore contributing to our goal; therefore wouldn't it be worth paying attention to also the materials, colours, forms and shapes besides functionality?

As a group, we discussed the objects in a couple of meetings and agreed that they would be positive additions to our 'community centre' concept. They could be 'visible' structures scattered all over the city, or they could be 'invisible' in places like airports, nightclubs or metal recycling centres.

We firstly noted down the important common themes that came up and categorised our ideas/concepts into 4 to choose from as our main focus. These were 'small installations, large installations, small devices/objects planted in the city, and personal devices:

Then with the majority decision, we started focusing on the category of "Large installation or buildings in public spaces that we have referred to as "community centres". Smaller individual versions of these spaces (like the AI Escape pods) and 'sound collector & convertor city objects' were also considered in addition to the community centres. We have set this idea of the 'community centre' as the base and gathered the favourite ideas and concepts from all of us to apply on and enhance this base.

Things started to get more interesting when we started to talk about intelligent machines. Could we somehow incorporate robots to make the city even smarter? It is not even that utopic anymore considering the existence of the social robots such as those delivering medication in Milton Keynes, policing in Dubai, acting like teaching assistants for autistic children, or something like Sophia, which said with a not-so-comforting smile that she (Or, it? Can the robots be gendered?) will destroy humans.
<br>
<br>
We have already started interacting with them, I really don't think it would be shocking, at least not for too long, if tomorrow we saw humanoid robots roaming in the city.
<br>
<br>
Talking about robots brought up an unexpected but a very important topic; "equality and class". We talked about how assigning the manual and dangerous jobs to robots could completely augment the society by changing the class system. If the robots could work in these jobs operated/teleoperated by people who used to be responsible for these jobs; the whole education system could change, the perceived value of certain types of jobs could increase; the lower class, who would typically be responsible for these jobs could vanish and we could all belong to the same class.
