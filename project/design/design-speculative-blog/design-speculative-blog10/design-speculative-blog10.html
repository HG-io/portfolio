Is it really doable? Can we produce energy from sound? Can we transform the city into a big ear? Can we convert sound into energy?
<br>
<br>
Research says that we can and we already do it. If you have ever used a microphone, you have converted sound into electrical energy. What would that mean for us?
<br>
<br>
The physics of sound lets us know that it is technically possible to convert sound into energy, however not in the scale we would wish for at the moment . We talked about this at one of the meetings after the mid-crit and despite getting good feedback on our progress and the video produced, which detailed our concepts so far, we started panicking about whether we were doing the right thing by focusing on sound. However, with further discussion, we came to the conclusion that our focus was still relevant and we should instead focus on what it would mean for the society to have sound as a key energy source. Therefore, in this project, we assume that this will change by 2030, that it will be economically viable to produce vast amount of energy from sound.

One thing I would have liked to do more of and earlier in the project was talking about what it would mean to have 'sound' as an energy source for the residents of the city.
<br>
<br>
Sound is already a part of the society and the culture. We communicate mainly by means of sound, we experience sound in many different forms and contexts that allow us to identify our environment, we decide based on sound, we create sound and we live with constant sound, ie. the sound of the people, animals, nature, machines, objects.
<br>
<br>
We take important decisions based on the experience of sound. We connect with and separate ourselves from others if we have different preferences in sound. We form communities based on sound.
<br>
<br>
Sound can tell us the time and place. We gather knowledge through sound and make sense of the space we occupy. It is already very integrated in our lives, making it a very relevant focus in our smart city project, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>
Although it is already part of the society, it is quite 'invisible' at the moment even though it is something we take for granted and experience everyday in different forms, with positive and negative effects. If we were to implement our idea, the meaning of sound would inevitably change, in that we will be more aware of the presence of sound through the artifacts, like the sound collector objects, we will come across everyday, as well as our active involvement in creating energy through sound.
<br>
<br>
We performed a storyboarding exercise to visualise how this new system of converting sound into energy could look like:

One of our group members had the idea of accommodating very loud noises in the city (such as of machinery, robots etc) so that more energy is created, and making people wear earplugs outside so that they can cope with the noise. This instantly brought up the current state of the world, the face masks worn during the pandemic and other restrictions we have been experiencing in the past year. I thought that this could go terribly wrong. I probably reacted against this very strongly as to me this meant that we were creating an unpleasant atmosphere on one side while trying to do something positive on the other. If we were to break one thing also important in the society, while building another, I wouldn't call it a success story. The others seemed not to be that much into the idea either and it was discarded in the end, and we said that such loud environments could be set up outside the city, still producing the energy, which can then be sent to the city.
<br>
<br>
I thought about this a bit more later, specifically about how surprised (and mostly annoyed) I am when people resist masks or vaccines during this pandemic period when they seem to be for the benefit of the society. They resist them probably for similar reasons such as fighting against oppression (or a perceived one), would people resisting earplugs be something similar then? I still don't know what to make of this but I still don't agree with 'forced' earplugs, while thinking that, possibly, 'noise pollution' will have a different name and meaning, the society will need and want more of it to run their city; maybe people will sacrifice certain things such as wearing noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs most of the time and it will be the new normal.
