<h2>Brainstorming, Ideation and Designing Our Toolkit</h2>

<p class="blogtext">Miro and Notion with everything they offer have been the most useful tools for us where we have organised our observations, ideas, inspirations, questions, reference images, videos, and anything relevant to the project that needed to be communicated. It made our communication much more fluent and timely.
<br>
<br>
We started with ideation as soon as we met as a group. So far, we have explored the aspects we want to focus on, the direction we could take, and the conditions. We almost already agreed on focusing on 'sound' instantly as everyone seemed to have some sort of interest in exploring it. We have continued to brainstorm with the focus on aspects such as that of sound itself (eg. sound sources, sound applications and anything that may be relevant in sound context), space, materials and devices.
<br>
<br>
This was the beginning of our custom (digital) toolkit design and this one got as close to physical ideation cards as it could have. When I remembered doing this exercise long time ago, I wished we could have done it in person because I am 100% convinced that it would have been more productive and fun without the zoom fatigue.

This was an exercise I suggested in order to stimulate our thinking towards generating ideas based on sound. In 2014, I was a participant in a research project on Interactive Computer Generated Audiovisuals at Goldsmiths run by Nuno Correia, an audiovisual artist and then PhD student, now a researcher/lecturer, supervised by Atau Tanaka, a musical interaction researcher. This was essentially a sketching workshop towards developing ideas on new tools for audiovisual performance*. The reason I mention this is that, when we were asked to do this activity in groups, we did not yet have much context, or a plan, or direction, we were given a title, 'Sound' with 4 categories (if I remember correctly; people, place, sensors and devices) and were asked to write down whatever came to mind.

I suggested using this affinity mapping exercise as a warm-up activity to make us start thinking of broader aspects of 'sound' and as well as possible design ideas and contexts. Although this felt a bit 'awkward' in the beginning, a couple of the group members asked whether there were any criteria to base our brainstorming on as it felt too broad, but it eventually turned into a fun activity. We spent some time on it and left it for the future weeks. As we started progressing in the following weeks, we were coming back to some of the notes in these stickies, picking relevant ones to discuss and use in the project.
