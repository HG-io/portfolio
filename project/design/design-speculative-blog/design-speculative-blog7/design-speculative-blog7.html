<h2>The Conflict: What About the Big Data?</h2>

From the brief: “Smartness", here, is implemented through the collection, aggregation and analysis of data. Citizen’s bodies, and their flows, consumption and communications, are tracked and monitored to optimise the efficiency of civic operations and public life."
<br>
<br>
While we did talk about data privacy early on as a group, we have not spent too much time on it, yet we do make sure to consider and value it while working on the project as it seems to be important to all of us.
I keep going back and forth between the pros and cons of smart cities. Especially as I think about places like China, where data collection seems to be a part of daily life.
<br>
<br>
There seems to be no way of securing data privacy and protection as it is exactly that data making it possible to implement smart city applications. Big Data leads to a lot of opportunities., which may sound positive, yet it is very possible to assume that there will always be intentions and applications that will not be ethical, and then they will find a way of making it into the reality, because it will benefit someone somewhere who has the power to make it happen.
<br>
<br>
Companies make money out of our data, this applies not only to smart cities, but almost every technology we use today in our daily life. It is not really possible to log into Facebook and not share a piece of data no matter how insignificant it might be. And then, in the context of smart cities, is it really bad to share our data if it is for our good?

Recently, I came across "Data Utility" in a blog post from 2018 by Kasper Jensen from The Academy of Smarter Communities (TASC), titled Towards a Data Utility *. From what I understand, they are publicly-funded but independent companies. They manage the processing of the data and anyone interested in smart city applications can use them, whether they are big corporations or small start-ups. From what it sounds like, this is a good approach as at least it allows everyone to benefit from the gathered data.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there is no way of controlling what data is being used and for what, but data utilities allow the anonymisation of personal data. I feel that the transparency of data usage should be increased and citizens should be involved in the process of data storage, processing, evaluation and usage. Whilst I think that this would not be easy in practice considering the limited awareness yet a lot of different views on data; giving all the power to governments or -even worse- private companies would probably be less than ideal. I could not suggest a practical solution but it should be actively thought about by both the providers and the citizens to find a middle ground, possibly some kind of union or an independent regulator body (?).
<br>
<br>
Who owns the data?
<br>
<br>
What they do with it and when?
<br>
<br>
Who can access it and for what?
<br>
<br>
These are important questions in need of clear answers, while I also believe that there is a lot of unfounded speculation and scaremongering in the media about the smart city concept.
