Concept video as a medium was ideal for us because we wanted to use a narrative to talk about our smart city concepts. We wanted the video to put the pieces of our work so far together as a reference for ourselves to think about and work on, but also as a creative output which would also provide valuable feedback from both Alex, Axel and the classmates. At that stage, just before the mid-crit session, the feedback was especially important for us.
<br>
<br>
We have gathered reference images and notes to each other on our Miro board and further links for inspirational resources, informative and research articles and videos on Notion by regularly contributing and discussing them at every meeting; therefore, by the time we decided to create a video, we had had a very rich group resource centre.
<br>
<br>
As someone experienced in audio-visual production, I took on the role of the producer and created the video below just before our mid-crit session so that we could get the very much needed feedback on our progress. Original animation, video footage, digital sketches as well as public domain video clips were used in the production. Following our discussions, before I started the video, I went back to the group with a script, which we reviewed and made the final changes to. The narration was done and recorded by Michael and was added to the video.
Our approach was experimental with clear arthouse influences. We talked about directors who inspired us such as Adam Curtis, Lars von Trier, Alex Gibney etc. The narrative was very important for us by which we wanted to achieve an engaging but also clear and unembellished tone. There was a very fine line between a dystopian/utopian tone vs a more neutral one, and we had aimed for the latter.
<br>
<br>
I tried to compose a repetitive and atmospheric soundtrack with subtle changes in the sound design and pitch, coded them according to the changes in the video and in a way that wouldn't mask the narrative. We just wanted the soundtrack to support the narrative and make an impact with the subtle changes in sound without being under the spot light. This video was a very useful tool allowing us to define and share our scope and approach to the brief, describe our direction and concepts, as well as the aesthetics we value. I personally enjoyed this part of the project very much.
<br>
<br>
The narrative starts in 2020 with the pandemic and we talk about its impact on the city and the society briefly, especially the aspects important within the scope of our project and what we want to focus on. Then we move to the future, 2030, where our concepts would be more relevant. We see the time between 2020 and 2030 as a transition period and 2030 is when we are able to talk about our concepts turning into reality.
<br>
<br>
We wanted this video to set the context, ie. where our concepts were coming from and why; and what our concepts were at the stage we were in.

<strong>Part1: Year 2020 - The Pandemic: The Reset</strong>
<br>
A global pandemic started and took control of our cities and lives,
<br>
The first year was challenging, with loud noises of uncertainty.
<br>
We slowly started adapting. It was a time the government was very loud, and the cities were quiet.
<br>
Even the most liberal of cities.
<br>
We did not have control of our lives anymore, we just had to stay still for the safety of others and ourselves.
<br>
Suddenly the city wasn’t the city we knew.
<br>
Our everyday was new.
<br>
We were getting confused, frustrated, restless.
<br>
Then we felt something was changing inside us.
<br>
We were learning to take a step back.
<br>
We were seeing and being offered all these alternatives that were never an option before.
<br>
Something unexpected started happening. It was something positive.
<br>
Suddenly, the skies appeared a more intense shade of blue,
<br>
The air we were breathing – much fresher.
<br>
We were witnessing how slowing down was bringing back nature’s soul.
<br>
Climate change was now visible.
<br>
Suddenly, more of us were aware of the damages we were causing to our environment.
<br>
We had never spent this much time with our families before.
<br>
We didn’t have to travel unnecessarily.
<br>
Digitization was happening so fast that suddenly we had all the tools to live our life from home.
<br>
We hated this at first.
<br>
Then, something even more unexpected was happening...
<br>
We were reassessing our priorities.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Part 2: Year 2030: We Create Our City</strong>
<br>
We have recovered from the pandemic, so have our cities.
<br>
It has not been straightforward.
<br>
Suddenly we had other issues to deal with.
<br>
The noise was deafening, when suddenly we were able to get out of our inner-city exile.
<br>
We were facing the fact that our energy reserves were suffering.
<br>
The end of the pandemic was as traumatic as its beginning.
<br>
This time, though, we were smarter and in control.
<br>
We could not leave the decisions and the action to governments with different agendas.
<br>
We had experienced closely how suddenly one wrong action would bring the world onto its knees.
<br>
We knew what we did not when we were living our lives on automation pre-pandemic.
<br>
We’ve changed, so has our city.
<br>
We have cleaner and quieter streets, fresher air, equality, welfare and happier people.
<br>
Our lives are surprisingly better,
<br>
We are clear about our priorities.
<br>
We are clear about what we want to do with our lives.
<br>
We don’t have that barrier called ‘the privilege’ anymore.
<br>
We now have our machine residents. They act nothing like the bad machines that we saw in sci-fi movies.
<br>
Lower class, does not mean anything.
<br>
Everyone has the same privileges,
<br>
To the point that they aren’t privileges anymore.
<br>
There are only 2 classes now: human class and machine class.
<br>
We don’t have to manually clean the streets, operate explosives, crawl under the ground to extract coal, work in dangerous building sites or expose ourselves to radiation.
<br>
We do not have to get sick or die doing our job and live with the awareness of that risk.
<br>
We now have our machine collaborators doing that.
<br>
We do not need to lose our jobs, for a matter of fact, quite the opposite.
<br>
The machines are operated from anywhere now with bodysuits and 360-cameras, thanks to full-body motion tracking, by the previously so-called ‘lower class’.
<br>
By preserving the movement of the body as opposed to sitting in front of screen, the human operators manage to stay fit and healthy, without the risk of sickness and death.
<br>
They can work from home, or from the community centres scattered in the city.
<br>
These community centres breathe in noise and breathe out energy.
<br>
They convert our unwanted amplified noises into energy that we can use to run our cities.
<br>
They are our new power stations, where no one gets hurt, and everyone has the chance to contribute with their presence.
<br>
Our loud laugh is now giving us electricity, so do our tearful screams.
<br>
Our kids are making noise to heat our homes.
<br>
Energy is a free and open-source human right now.
<br>
We organise concerts inside these structures to “raise energy” when we need more.
<br>
Our community centres are also places for escape.
<br>
When we want to be alone, or stay away from the noise of the city,
<br>
We can enter any of these structures, into the isolation booths, where the unwanted outside noise is manipulated into pleasurable sounds.
<br>
These pods are spaces for relaxation and connection with others through frequencies.
<br>
Scattered in the city are the sound objects that may be in the shape of a bench, a letter box, stairs, traffic lights or bike rails; anything that can be programmed to collect the noise and send to our community-run power stations.
