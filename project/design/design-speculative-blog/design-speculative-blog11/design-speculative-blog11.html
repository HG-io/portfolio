<h2>Sound into Free and Open-Source Energy</h2>

We were lucky to have an architect in our group in this project who translated our ideas into 3D visualisations very accurately. It was exciting to see what we had been talking about for many weeks.
<br>
<br>
Daniel designed a futuristic structure to represent the sound collecting buildings in public spaces. We have referred to them as "community centres" where people gather or use the space as an escape to spend alone time away from the noise of the city. There are facilities inside, like shops, bars, pubs, cafes, children's playgrounds, etc. There would also be opportunities to organise community-run events such as concerts 'to raise energy' by converting loud noises into usable energy, e.g. electricity. These structures collect the sound and convert it on the spot to release as energy for various purposes such as providing lighting to the city, heating, and electricity at homes.
<br>
<br>
In the final stages of the project, we went back to the beginning and asked some questions:
<br>
<br>
"Would this system really benefit the society and how would this system change the society, would would it mean for the residents to have such a system? We agreed that the sound-to-energy conversion would make a positive change in the society, by enabling everyone to contribute as well as benefit from the energy created independent of class or background; it would be free, something that current systems cannot or do not provide, and open-source in that it could be created in different ways, places and at any time. We also agreed that employing/managing robots for jobs that put people at risk and place them in lower classes could lead to very significant changes and new structures in the society by changing the modern life's unspoken and invisible 'class system'.
<br>
<br>
However, we also talked about possible challenges such as how corporations or governments would approach this? If they couldn't monetise energy, would they allow such a system? Would people actually want to be actively involved in this system which meant more individual and communal responsibility while it would be more sustainable and low or zero-cost; or would they rather prefer someone else did it for them, like now, and they paid for it? These are questions we cannot have the answers for but it was still important to discuss as these would come up as very real issues should a system such as ours be proposed as an alternative on a planet where non-renewable energy, which comes from fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, natural gas) will run out at some point and won't be replenished for long periods, which may cause energy shortages and unsustainable systems for creating energy from artificial renewable sources, giving all the power to corporations.
