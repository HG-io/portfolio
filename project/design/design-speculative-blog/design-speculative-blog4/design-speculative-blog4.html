What we need is to free our minds to not only see but also create new ways of being and doing within the same physical spaces. Fabulation is a tool we have started exploring to be able to do this.
<br>
<br>
In what ways can we tell, retell and understand a story differently? How can we take active responsibility for prototyping and co-creating futures? This takes me to something I read in the book “Design Noir: The Secret Life of Electronic Objects”. Dunne & Raby suggests: “Instead of thinking about appearance, user-friendliness or corporate identity, industrial designers could develop design proposals that challenge conventional values."
<br>
<br>
I think this could apply to all kinds of designers and lead us to ask different types of questions that will take us to the kinds of answers we want.
<br>
<br>
As a group, we spent some time in 'What If' questions; everyone came with a set of questions and mine were:
<br>
<br>
What if the city were a blank canvas?
<br>
<br>
What if the city could respond to us?
<br>
<br>
What if the city could co-design?
<br>
<br>
What if the city could co-decide?
<br>
<br>
What if the city could reject?
<br>
<br>
And then with 'Sound' in mind, I added further questions to the list:
<br>
<br>
What if we tried a new relationship with the noise of the city?
<br>
<br>
What if we generated our own energy from a free source such as sound?
<br>
<br>
By gathering our what if questions, we spent some time on the tutorial exercise:
<br>
<br>
"When......., What If........., The city becomes........"
<br>
<br>
The process of thinking about 'what if questions and answers' stimulated our thinking and brought up a lot of references such as Orwell's allegorical work Animal Farm, where the mistreated animals take over the farm only to mistreat when they have the power. This might seem unrelated to what we were doing but it was an interesting moment which very much shaped the most important value of our project very early, ie. that our design would not give the power to any specific group, but to everyone in equal measures. It is not wrong to say that the 'what if' questions and the references that were brought up as a result of them have been critical in what we have and will achieve.

Daniela Rosner's book, Critical Fabulations: Reworking the Methods and Margins of Design, has been a significant reference in this project, and for me personally, very helpful to understand how I should or should not be thinking. It is a very insightful book, reflecting on not only the design of the technologies, but also how the users of these technologies make use of them to create.

Although the context is different here, I found this video of Liz Neely on fabulation very interesting, helpful and applicable to our project. She talks about fabulation and how it can stimulate creativity, make you see and produce results differently.
