After a few group discussions and further reading, we were finally clear that we did not have to offer tangible solutions for today’s world and problems, neither did we need to consider the limitations of today's technology; but we were meant to spark discussions on the possibilities. We still have moments when we get unsure about where we are in the scale of possibility to fantasy but as we discuss, we are able to identify our position and take a step back or forward, as needed.</p>

Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby has been one of the most significant resources in this project. Apart from being a good overview of the realm of speculative design, it is also quite an entertaining book with very interesting examples. I already feel that this will be a go-to book for me as in my design practice. According to Dunne and Raby, 'designers should also focus on the future rather than designing only for today and that they should raise the question of how to address the challenges of the future with design'.
<br>
<br>
I recently also read an article by Tony Ho Tran*, a content marketing consultant and writer, which helped me understand how and when speculative design might be the best way forward, especially in the context of bigger societal issues.
<br>
<br>
In this article, to define the scope of speculative design, examples of possible questions are given such as:
<br>
<br>
"How should design impact the entire world?
<br>
<br>
How can we design for a healthier ecosystem?
<br>
<br>
What can we do to influence future cultures?
<br>
<br>
How can future technologies impact our products and services—and vice versa?
<br>
<br>
What don’t we want to see from the future?"
<br>
<br>
Tran also mentions a very important aspect of this book, which is the taxonomy of futures it provides. This has helped me understand the differences and similarities between the 'possible', the 'probable', the 'fantastic' yet I still tend to bounce from one side to the other and feel confused time to time. I must say thanks to my group for all the grounding discussions, I think I would have struggled more if I were to be doing this project on my own. One thing about the book is that, while they give a lot of examples, those examples are not very thorough and mostly only offers a 'preview' of the design intentions. I think more detailed analysis in the book would be really helpful. Nevertheless, it has still been a critical resource in this project and I wish to re-read it with a slower pace in the near future.
<br>
<br>
Speculative design approach will help us anticipate the future and make us see colours and textures of the present we may be failing to notice. We aim to be speculative by challenging the current systems for which there may be better alternatives and also think about our relationship with our environment.
