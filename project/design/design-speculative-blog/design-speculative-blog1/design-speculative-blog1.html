<h2>Intro: Thinking About the Smart City </h2>

<p class="blogtext"> It is an interesting time to be thinking about smart cities. The current state of life has an inevitable impact on how I will approach this project. The thoughts never exist in solitude; they will be distorted, twisted, diverted or manipulated by what they see. At this moment, it is hard to imagine a smart city that would bring joy to its residents; while it is also a very relevant time to do so, when we can see the effects of how we treat our environment so transparently. It had never been this crystal clear globally. How we treat our environment, ourselves and our lives should be under close observation right now.
<br>
<br>
This workbook will probably be a space for also the questions and conflicts I have and will have about smart cities, a diary of group progress, as well as a summary of individual contributions, thoughts and opinions.
<br>
<br>
At our first 'warm-up' meeting, we talked about 'what smart city meant for us'; whether it was something we had ever thought about or had experience with, whether we were "pro or anti-smart city" .
When I think about the smart city, luxury and utopia/dystopia are the first things to come to mind. Also sensors, a lot of sensors... And transparency, maybe not a well-understood one for the residents of these settlements.
<br>
<br>
The word 'smart' brings up the idea of mind, and thinking. Is a city thinking for itself really possible? If we as humans can't always think well enough to solve our current daily issues, how would the city be able to do it, programmed by who?
We can't rule out the spontaneous and the unexpected, which might present itself with much problematic consequences in smart cities with mass effects.
There will be quite a lot to think about and I hope we will be able to share the load as a group as we keep working on it.</p>
