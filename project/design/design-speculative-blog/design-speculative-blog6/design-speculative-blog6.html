Sound art and installations have been the major source of inspiration for me in this project. I have a deep interest in sound art and have been influenced by artists such as Luigi Russolo, Marcel Duchamp, John Cage and Bill Fontana to name a few from the most commonly known ones; as well as less known artists such as Susan Philipsz  and Carsten Nicolai, and not to forget all the inspiring audio-visual works I have had the chance to see and participate in in disused warehouses and small basements in Europe and UK in the past 10 years.

Apart from sound art, there were a few other things that gave me ideas, such as the creative inventor and futurist Hugo Gernsback's strange helmet "The Isolator" (1925). The motivation is pretty reasonable, which seems to be partly similar to that of noise-cancelling headphones ie. blocking out noise, and narrowing the field of view to improve focus and concentration; however it does have this strong air of dystopia.
<br>
<br>
Influenced by this helmet, I got an idea of a wearable that could be used as both an isolator and also manipulator, ie. something that could manipulate unwanted sounds into pre-chosen pleasant ones for the user. Not exactly like an mp3 player which already helps block out unwanted noise and replace it with music but something that still allows you to experience the sound of the city with a sound filter. I still like this idea but I feel that in terms of this project, we all want to address something more impactful.

Another significant source of inspiration was an exhibition I visited in 2019 at Triennale di Milano in Italy, called "Broken Nature" **, which I also mentioned during one of our group meetings. Luckily, I took a lot of photos and videos there, which have found good use in this project. The exhibition was not necessarily about smart cities but, in fact, much broader than that and applicable to homes, streets, cities, countries, continents, even planets. It explored restorative design with the aim of helping us- the human species- assess and repair our complicated relationship with our environment and the other species we share it with. Some of the design projects I found to be relevant to this project are:
