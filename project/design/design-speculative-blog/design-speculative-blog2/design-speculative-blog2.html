<h2>What Aspect(s) of City Life Do We Want to Address?</h2>
</div>

<p class="blogtext">The first important question in the group was whether we wanted to focus on the society as a whole, or a very specific aspect of the society? After a bit of discussion and Miro exercise which led to a few early themes, we discussed further by involving conditions and our values. Important common values that came up were:
  
<br>
<br>
- good quality of life for everyone
<br>
<br>
- sustainability
<br>
<br>
- smart living by being smart people
<br>
<br>
- transparency
<br>
<br>
- equality and accessibility of the smart city features by everyone
  
<br>
<br>
So that smart city should not be another add on for only the privileged who can afford, like the very expensive air filtration devices installed in the apartments of wealthy people in Beijing against the extreme air pollution. I feel that especially this value, 'equality/design for everyone', will have an important impact on how we shape this project and what we come up with. I feel that it is a very positive and at the same time ambitious criteria for us to set. Working towards designing for everyone will lead to stimulating discussion since it will be more difficult to design for a society made up of people from all sorts of backgrounds and life-styles than a section of the society, for which we could create personas and identify key points to focus on, whereas everyone means every one of all ages, genders, nationality, education, economic background and beliefs.

Before thinking and discussing with the group about what to focus on, I am writing down my core formula to frame my ideas and which then can be elaborated.
<br>
<br>
City= The land + people + infrastructures
<br>
<br>
There are various aspects to focus on such as housing, security, mobility, waste management, healthcare, energy and community engagement. My initial feeling is to design a system to cover as many of these as possible with as little effort required as possible by the residents.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to find a hybrid solution that would encompass them all, like a core infrastructure that can regulate and resolve all the matters of the city? Is this a utopia? Can the technical pre-conditions be really met for most smart city projects we hear about, or more importantly, do people want to live in these cities?
<br>
<br>
A truly smart city would be one that would come with as many solutions to problems and opportunities as possible with the minimum effort from the residents and low cost of implementation and management. Cost is something to take into account as it is likely to be reflected in taxes, possibly in the form of a 'smart city tax'?
<br>
<br>
Since I started this project, I have been remembering scenes from a cartoon I used to watch as a kid, The Jetson's, which was apparently launched in 1962 while it was set in 2062. Now looking back, I find it even more fascinating. It almost feels like it was produced by someone from the future. Currently in 2021, seeing the driverless cars, service drones, social robots, and the internet of things in general; a lot of elements from 2062 of the Jetsons seem like possible scenarios, even sooner.
<br>
<br>
Their version does not seem dystopian to me, but some may disagree, which takes me to this video shared by one of the group members on Notion in our Resources page, where Ben Green warns against the possible implications of the smart city concepts as they are now. He examines the city as: The smart city, the liveable city, the democratic city, the just city, the responsible city, the innovative city.

While I see the validity of many of his points such as 'technology should not be the only focus in smart city design and it is dangerous to do so', I also couldn't fully connect with what he says as not all people researching or working in the design of smart cities seem to be focused on only technology and nothing else. I think it is healthy and necessary to question; however, his over-generalising tone makes his content sound a bit scaremongering and not very well-informed, at least in my opinion.
