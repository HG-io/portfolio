This project was carried out in the earlier months of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. I aimed to design an interactive digital technology that aimed to 'encourage and revive the connectedness of a specific community by getting to know the members, understanding their previous and current relevant experiences and activities, needs, frustrations, and experience with digital technologies'.

  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
Since the Covid-19 pandemic started in early 2020, there have been major changes in most aspects of our lives on a global level. One of these aspects is the social life. Currently, at the time of this project, all venues in the UK are closed and it is not possible to attend any type of gathering or event indoors or outdoors. Recently there have been online opportunities such as live streams on various platforms, however, most of these experiences fail to deliver the same level of satisfaction as in-person events.

<h4 class="special-font-h4">The Community</h4>

<div class="centerthetext">
<div class="flex-container1-text">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
The members of the community of interest in this project regularly attend music and art events in London. One of the most popular events, KAOS, has been running since 2003. There are around 400+ members in the community and they are members of a private social media group, where they follow the relevant events.
<br>
<br>
Many of the attendees work/study in creative fields, many are freelance artists, with varying ages from early 20s to late 30s, while the majority are under 30. They have been attending similar events in London for the past 5-10 years and see each other regularly. Their main connection has been through their interest in music and arts.

The main research question is “How can the community be enhanced by improving the connectedness with the help of an interactive digital technology?”.
Following was building a research plan and a schedule for the research. The ideal approach for the aimed qualitative data collection was semi-structured interviews by which the user would be encouraged to express themselves freely, without having to follow a strict guideline.

The screening resulted in the recruitment of 6 participants out of 9 people.
<br>
<br>
A typical interview lasted for an hour (-/+), starting with greetings and a short introduction, notifying the user before starting the recording, asking them the questions that had been prepared before the meeting in a semi-structured and conversational manner. The majority of the questions aimed to understand the relevant past and current behaviours, needs and goals, alongside understanding how they use digital technology and what their skill levels are.
The recordings were saved on the hard drive to be transcribed for thematic data analysis.

An opportunity emerged to observe a relevant Facebook community thread on how they felt about the current restrictive situation and its consequences.
Although it was a public thread, permission was obtained to use and quote, and use the screenshot of the thread without disclosing the full names.
The insight was in line with the interviews as:
“Connectedness was desired only in the way the community used to have it; that is, in person, at certain locations, at certain times of the week/month; they did not desire to connect in a different context outside of that experience. There were already groups within the community maintaining a satisfactory level of connectedness; the problem was not being able to experience the setting and activities that were connecting them before the pandemic.

<strong>Further Need for Insight: A Social Media Poll</strong>
<br>
<br>
At the stage of Persona creation, further research was thought to be necessary. A social media poll was created. It asked people whether they would still enjoy attending events if they were with friends only, the results were 64% to 36% with the majority of people wanting to connect with the experience rather than the people.
It was clear that some people did not mind the current pandemic-related lack of in-person connection “with the people themselves”, many of them even said that “they preferred the superficial nature of being part of this community, which came together and has grown to dance, express themselves in unique ways with people they feel comfortable with. What mattered was the activity and being at a certain setting where the attendees were those specific people; the connection was desired mainly in that setting. Many mentioned that they do not necessarily want to connect with the others in the pandemic, yet they would want to connect with the experience (of going to KAOS and a few other similar events).
This insight, which was later supported by the created Personas and Empathy Maps.

The participants had very similar interests and motivations in the context of being part of this community.<br>
The data gathered from the interviews and social media research led to two personas (Linn, female, 29) and Max (male, 24).<br>
Although they have differences in personality and their experience with the same community; their needs, goals and frustrations were not critically different; however, it was felt necessary to view them as users that might have different requirements for the final design due to the way they interact with their community. Linn is shy and quiet, she would attend the event on her own; on the other hand, Max, while having the same motivations, unlike Linn, he is very sociable, and he would spend most of his time with his friends. Therefore, while the personas may have characteristics and requirements in common, a significant difference, such as the way they interact, could potentially impact design decisions.

<div class="centerthetext">
<div class="flex-container1-text">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
To reframe the goal following the user interviews, observation, the poll and to set the requirements for the design, two <em>Point of View Statements</em> were created.
<br>
<br>
  
<strong>POV 1:</strong>
User: is as a 29 years old visual designer from London, (primary persona, Linn).
<br>
Need: is to find a way of enjoying her weekends again with her community during the time of the pandemic.
<br>
Insight: Linn, who is a shy and private person, is pessimistic and finds it very difficult to connect with her community. She thinks that the context is very different now and she is not comfortable enough to initiate connections.
<br>
<strong>POV 2:</strong>
User: is a 24 years old Marketing student from London (secondary persona, Max).
<br>
Need: is to find a way of enjoying his weekends again by connecting with his friends, who are part of the community, to claim his social life back and spend quality time with them.
<br>
Insight: Max studies in London and has been used to a certain life style since he started university. He is very sociable and loves to be surrounded by friends. He struggles to stay connected with his community even though he tries hard, due to reasons out of his control, such as the pandemic restrictions’ limiting activities and physical contact.

<h4 class="special-font-h4">Defining the Goals</h4>
<div class="centerthetext">
<div class="flex-container1-text">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
<strong>1- Creating a digital technology experience that will simulate the desired real life experience.</strong>
<br>
The users have made it clear that they would only be satisfied with a realistic experience that can successfully simulate their experience and interaction with their community before the pandemic started.
This is a very open-minded community, therefore they would be open to possibilities and experimentation as long as the key requirements are met, which links to the second goal; creating a digital technology away from the screen.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2- Creating a digital technology that does not replicate what is available.</strong>
<br>
The community already uses social media apps and other digital technologies for work or personal needs. It would be very difficult to engage them and expect high level of satisfaction in long term by asking them to try something that does exactly what the existing apps do.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3- Creating a digital technology that encourages engagement through creative interactivity.</strong>
<br>
The technology should enable creative ways of interaction and go beyond instant messaging and video calls, and be engaging and consistent.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4- Creating to evoke joy by means of technology.</strong>
<br>
Enjoyable experiences are memorable and can be habit-forming. This technology is being developed to create a positive alternative for a community which lost a lifestyle suddenly. Almost all users expressed how comfortable and safe they have felt when they attended certain events, while also enjoying themselves. These consistent positive experiences that the events have provided are also the reasons why they are valued and frequented by this community.
<br>
<br>
<strong>5- Creating an environment that will allow and encourage smooth interaction between the users of the technology.</strong>
In the context of this project, it is essential to design a solid structure of interaction between users using the technology; the aim is to connect the community. This technology should be seen as a tool, or a simulator, to solve a problem creatively.
<br>
<br>
<strong>6- Encouraging the connectedness through possible creative and innovative means of gatherings.</strong>
It is important to be actively researching and getting to know technologies of today and tomorrow to be able create a product with a long-term vision. Music and gatherings are the glue of the community, it is critical to focus on these elements.

It was clear that the design would need to have elements of realism where the user would feel 'being there'. Therefore, I started exploring Extended Reality technologies and wearables. Conceptual design research started with a mood board with images of various headsets and other non-technological wearables such as water goggles and gas masks.

Moving from conceptual design to detailed design encouraged exploring current innovative research projects such as the Holoscopic 3D Vision with the H3D (Holographic 3D) Single Lens Camera developed by the Brunel University, and Multimodal Acoustic Trap Display that is capable of creating animated holograms with sound, which the user can interact with. These emerging technologies have been inspirational for this project.

At the time of the project, there were very limited opportunities to conduct a detailed in-person evaluation due to the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, however, it was still possible to gain insights via an interactive app prototype in Figma and concept testing of the hardware. I created 3D animated characters and developed an AR experience, then produced videos to use for concept testing. These videos aimed to simulate the experience of viewing 3D avatars with the headset.
<br><br>
While the primary goal of this project was to design a technology for a socially restrictive period, the designed products can have longer term meaningful use cases and can provide an alternative to less interactive virtual events/platforms with the advancement of XR and Web3 technologies, and the accessibility of hardware such as HMDs and motion-capture suits.
