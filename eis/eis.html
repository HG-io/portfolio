<strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong>
<br>
<br>
This report details a usability evaluation of the Alzheimer’s Society website https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/.
<br>
<br>
The website was evaluated by pre-planned <strong>remote moderated usability testing</strong> with 7 participants on the 24th, 25th and 26th April 2021, using a <strong>First Impression Test</strong>, <strong>Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) method</strong> and <strong>Reaction Box</strong> activity at the end-of-session, which was created based on <strong>Microsoft’s Desirability Toolkit</strong> method, enabling the evaluator to understand what the user had thought about the website as a whole, examine the certain sections of the website and determine possible usability issues.
<br>
<br>
The data gathered led to a list of findings followed by recommendations to tackle the usability issues of the website. The major findings negatively affecting the user experience with their severity rating are included in this report and with more detail in the rainbow sheet included in the appendices to help improve the overall experience of navigating the website; as well as certain critical user journeys presented later in the report, which may have an impact on the donations and fundraising activities, which the charity would rely on to continue to help their users.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>General Recommendation:</strong>
<br>
<br>
"Review and redesign the Information Architecture of the website, starting from the Homepage/global navigation items “About Dementia” and “Get Involved”, which contain a high number of submenu items."
<br>
<br>
The 4 primary recommendations following the tasks:
<br>
<br>
1- In the Donations section, present the Donation options more consistently, ideally presenting the two online donation options on one page and making the required “In memory of someone” section optional and review its location.
<br>
2- Maintain consistency in the pages, such as in the events section, by using a user-friendly layout that displays the key information quickly.
<br>
3- Redesign the online community/forum section with better organisation of Topic and Thread structure and improve the outdated search functionality.
<br>
4- Improve the navigation and findability of information by more logical organisation, labelling and the use of relevant imagery.

The aim of this report is to serve as a guide to encourage positive changes in the design of the Alzheimer’s Society website.
<br>
<br>
Dementia is a very common chronic condition with no known cure and Alzheimer’s Society is a leading charity in UK providing support to those affected and funding research towards a possible cure in the future.
<br>
<br>
To analyse the usability of the website, key tasks were determined according to the user journeys below:
<br>
<br>
<strong>1- The landing page:</strong> How well the landing page (home page) works
<br>
<br>
<strong>2- Overall UX:</strong> Evaluation of the user experience of the landing page and the website as a whole
<br>
<br>
<strong>3- Evaluation of the following three user journeys:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>3a- Donation:</strong> The overall experience of donating through the website
<br>
<strong>3b- Fundraising:</strong> Discoverability and the sign-up process for fundraising
<br>
<strong>3c- Forum/Online community:</strong> Finding and engaging with a specific topic
<br>
<br>
<strong>4- The findability of resources</strong> within multiple areas of the site, that would be useful for a carer who wants to help increase the independence of someone living with dementia who has memory problems.
<br>
<br>
To gain insights directly from users themselves, remote moderated usability testing sessions were conducted with 7 participants. The first one had been planned as a pilot session, however, was later included with the rest during the data analysis since the session provided valuable insight with minimal practical issues. Zoom was the choice of platform and the sessions that utilized screen recording of the participant were audio and video recorded with real-time transcription, which was later proof-read and edited. The data, both qualitative and quantitative, were analysed and helped gather several findings and recommendations towards better usability and more pleasant experience of the website.

<h2> Methodology</h2>
</div>
    
<div class="centerthetext">
<div class="flex-container1-text">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
<strong>Participants</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Recruitment Criteria:</strong>
<br>
<br>
◘ Aged 18 and over
<br>
◘ With no known vulnerability such as being under 18, having physical or mental disabilities
<br>
◘ With no known sensitivity around the condition (dementia)
<br>
◘ With enough experience in using the computer and the internet
<br>
◘ Ideally UK-based, with good level of the English language, both written and spoken
<br>
<br>
For the moderated usability testing sessions, it was aimed to recruit a diverse range of participants who were experienced in using the internet. They were recruited online through social media.
<br>The initial step was an <strong>informal screening</strong> to assess their suitability based on the criteria above. Firstly, all participants were screened to identify whether they had any sensitivity around the topic of Alzheimer’s. Six of them had no personal experience or familiarity with it apart from general knowledge of the condition, one of them had a relative with the condition but they were happy to be part of the project.
<br>They were also asked about their experience in using the internet and all of them were highly experienced users with a long history of internet usage. 7 participants were recruited as a result of the screening.
<br>
Following verbal confirmation, the participants were sent a <strong>‘Participant Information’</strong> email including the details of the meeting such as the date and time, a brief description of the Alzheimer’s Society and the purpose of the usability testing to be performed.
<br>
The Sessions took place on the 24th, 25th and 26th February 2021. They lasted from 1 hour up to 1 hour 30 minutes. Due to the pandemic, all the sessions took place remotely.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Tools and Techniques</strong>
<br>
<br>
The participants were instructed to <strong>“think aloud”</strong>, ie. to verbalise their thoughts and actions as they were going through the tasks. The <strong>predefined tasks</strong> aimed at exploring the issues in terms of the overall user experience of the website, as well as specific user journeys as determined by the charity.  These tasks were formulated as <strong>“realistic scenarios”</strong> to be presented as engaging user journeys.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Pilot Test</strong>
<br>
<br>
One pilot test was scheduled to be carried out on the 24th February. This had initially been planned as a shorter session to go over the tasks only (as recommended by <em>Steve Krug, 2010</em>), however the participant was interested in the test as a whole and agreed to carry on with a full session. This meeting proved to be very helpful, not only to assess the tasks but also to get used to the flow of the session. It helped to confirm that the tasks had been tailored well, and the participant could engage with them. They remained unchanged as a result of the pilot testing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Tasks</strong>
<br>
<br>
Before the scenario-based tasks, the participants were asked to engage in the below:
<br>
<br>
<strong>1)First Impressions Test and Home Page Assessment</strong> to see what the participants’ first impressions would be when they saw the home page for a short period of time, 10 seconds in this case. This was followed by a tour of the home page and pre-test questions answered by the participants. The aim was to record the impressions of the participants and evaluate the overall user experience of the home page, which would also provide hints for the overall website experience.

<p class="blogtext">
<strong>2) Pre-test questions:</strong> The aim was to gather information relating to participants’ demographics, as well as relevant behaviours and habits around internet use and experience.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3) Pre-determined key user journeys</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Scenario 1:  Donation</strong>
<br>
<br>
◘ You are interested in making a donation for the Alzheimer’s Society while also learning more about the process and how the donations are used by the charity.
<br>
◘ You want to see the options available for donating and after assessing both, you decide to make a one-off donation to the charity. You will complete the steps until you need to enter any personal details to complete the task.
<br>
◘ How was your experience, if you could rate it from 1 to 7, 1: very difficult, 7: very easy?
<br>
<br>
<strong>Scenario 2: Fundraising</strong>
<br>
<br>
◘ You want to fundraise for the charity.
<br>
◘ Task: To be able to fundraise, you need to find the fundraising section and sign up for a fundraising opportunity. After you find the Fundraising section, you will want to know how it works and see examples. After you look at the options, you want to sign up for an event to fundraise.
<br>
How was your experience, if you could rate it from 1 to 7, 1: very difficult, 7: very easy?
<br>
<br>
<strong>Scenario 3:</strong>
<br>
<br>
◘ You want to visit the Forum to find out more about the symptoms and diagnosis of dementia for a friend. You want to find a relevant topic and thread, read a few replies, ask a question or respond to a thread. Where would you go for this and how would you do it?
<br>
◘ How was your experience, if you could rate it from 1 to 7, 1: very difficult, 7: very easy?
<br>
<br>
<strong>4) Findability of resources</strong>
<br>
<br>
Another scenario-based task that focused on evaluating the findability of information:
<br>
<br>
Your friend who is a carer of someone with dementia needs help with finding resources online on the Alzheimer’s Society website, specifically information relevant to the carers. You want to help your friend to look for information in various relevant sections of the website, with the aim of accessing resources which might help improve the independence of someone living with dementia.
<br>
How was your experience, if you could rate it from 1 to 7, 1: very difficult, 7: very easy?
<br>
<br>
<br>
These activities as a whole allowed the process of gathering data to be based on a systematic approach, helping the facilitator develop evaluations of the website as accurately as possible. As a result of the analysis of this data, the following findings and recommendations were formulated to improve the usability of the website.
<br>
<br>
The tasks were supported by additional activities with the intention of gaining more insight, such as:
<br>
<br>
<strong>SEQ (Single Ease Question):</strong> SEQ, a seven-point rating scale was used to allow the participants to rate their experience with the pre-determined tasks they completed (or attempted). It is a simple scale by which the participant is asked to rate how difficult a particular task was. 1 refers to very difficult, while to 7 means the participant found the task very easy.

<strong>Post-Task Reaction Box:</strong> The aim was to see the emotional response of the participant quickly after the tasks, to gather reflections and have an understanding of the participants’ experiences with the website and the tasks they’ve performed. The technique was based on the <strong>Microsoft Desirability Toolkit</strong>. <em>Google Jamboard</em> was used to design a reaction box exercise for each participant, where they were asked to choose 10 words out of 50 that could describe their feelings about the website, which they completed straight after the tests. They were also given the option to write down their own choice of word(s) if they needed to.

Effort was made to recruit participants of different genders, age groups as well as professional backgrounds. Three participants defined their gender as female, another three as male and one participant as gender neutral. The participants’ ages varied from early twenties up to late 40s. All participants reported having at least one higher education level degree.
<br>
<br>
Apart from the quantitative research that focused on collecting data on the demographics, the research mostly had a qualitative nature. The analysis process involved going through the written notes and the transcripts, "translating" them into meaningful chunks of information that would aim to describe what the participants did, how and why; and then comparing them to look for patterns.
<br>
<br>
None of the participants knew about the charity prior to the sessions, while six of them knew about the condition with one reporting to have a family member with the condition and the rest having a general understanding.
<br>
<br>
Four participants stated having donated online before via fundraising events and websites, while only two confirmed to have donated directly from a charity website, however also after being made aware of a fundraiser event. The other 5 said they never visited a charity website to donate while all participants said they never thought of going to a charity website to donate without being prompted. The participants were also asked whether they ever donated to a charity via offline means, to which all of them responded with 'Yes'.

<strong>SEQ</strong>
<br>
<br>
The participants were asked to rate their experience after every task, to which they responded as on the table below.
<br>
Even though SEQ was used in this research project, it is difficult to rely on it as a conclusive measure since the number of participants may not be enough to make a solid judgement; however, it did reveal that the participants in this study found the “findability of information” task the most difficult, followed by the “forum” task.

<strong>Overall Task Completion Rate</strong>
<br>
<br>
Despite the challenges in all tasks, completion rate was high, with only one participant failing to complete the user journey where they needed to find a relevant topic and engage with. It was felt by the facilitator that they could have eventually figured out how to do it, however, the participant seemed to get frustrated and lost the motivation to carry on with that particular task following a few attempts that resulted in failure.
<br>
All the other tasks were successfully completed by the participants with varying levels of confusion and frustration at the times they struggled. Despite the remote nature of the test, as a result of the observation of their facial expressions and tone of voice, it was likely that some of these participants would have given up on the task(s) in real life situations. Therefore, while the usability testing returned a high rate of overall task completion, in a real-life situation, this rate might be lower, if the participant experiences similar frustrations.

<strong>Severity Rating</strong>
<br>
<br>
Since most of the issues outlined affect various parts of the website, the choice of Severity Rating to use was the scale by Dumas and Redish (1999). In this scale, there are 4 levels:
<br>
<br>
4: Potential future enhancement
<br>
3: Minor usability issue
<br>
2: Issue that causes frustration and delay
<br>
1: Affects the completion of a task, therefore, high severity

<h2> Findings</h2>
</div>


<div class="centerthetext">
<div class="flex-container1-text">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
This section provides insight to the commonly reported issues and concerns by the 7 participants. Various issues were found in all the general UX reviews and user journey tasks. These are presented separately while they may affect each other and make the issues more pronounced, such as the information architecture and global navigation’s contributing to the issues of findability of information.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1- Homepage</strong>
<br>
<br>
 “The navigation menu looks cluttered”, as most of the participants stated.
<br>
They verbally expressed and it was clearly observed that they got overwhelmed once they clicked to see the details of the submenu items covered by the global navigation sections About Dementia, Get Support, Get Involved, Research and About Us.
<br>
Even though the website is very rich with useful information, the way the content is organised made the participants confused and spend more time than they would have liked to in order to find information. This issue affects the website as a whole in terms of finding information and navigation, therefore it is one of the most critical findings with high severity.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2- Overall UX</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Navigation</strong>
<br>
<br>
The lack of breadcrumbs sometimes makes navigation confusing and time-consuming, eg. while making a donation, or in the Forum sections, the user has to keep going back to reach previous pages, instead of using breadcrumbs, which would take much less time. The website is already dense in information and it has inconsistency and navigation issues causing users to click on pages by mistake and when they want to go back, they face further difficulty. This created frustration in users at various sections so it is included as a general UX issue, also with high severity.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3</strong>
<br>
<strong>a) Donation</strong>
<br>
“They ask too much personal information”. All participants chose to go to the Donations page by clicking “Donate Now” button.
<br>
In the donations section, the boxes where the user enters the information about their relatives, whose memory they are donating for, the user is faced with the requirement of disclosing personal information which they might not want to share, and this could directly cause the user not to continue with the donation, as mentioned by some of the participants. Without exception, all participants were confused by the requirement of the information asked to complete the donation process, while some were clearly annoyed by it. Most users mentioned them being inappropriate, too personal. It seemed to put off all of the participants. Another severe issue, that might be potentially causing drop-outs during the donation stage.
<br>
Furthermore, there is inconsistency in the monthly and one-off donation pages.  Make a single donation page is different from the Monthly donation page in that it has extra boxes below the donation amount input box.
<br>
Page: https://secure.alzheimers.org.uk/home/single-donation-amount.
<br>
The sections Make a Monthly Donation and Make a Single Donation have separate buttons, rather than an optional menu, which the users found unconventional. They preferred to be able to see the information for both options on one page, rather than clicking two different buttons for different sections, which are not consistent.
<br>
<br>
<strong>b) Fundraising</strong>
<br>
The participants were able to find the Fundraising section easily. However, once they moved to the Join an Event section and had a look at a few events before they chose one, they found out that the events have inconsistencies with different page layouts, and varying types of information and sign-up processes. In some events, everything was clearer, they could see all the information quickly with the help of the “blue information boxes” summarising the key facts and information to sign up for an event, while in others, they got confused because of the layout and found too much text-based information which they chose to skip. Later in the sign-up process, although the participants stated that it was conventional, they also mentioned that there was again a bit of “text clutter” and it would be better to try to present that information in a more reader-friendly way. In addition, the “Sign Up” button was present on the events’ main page for some of the events, while it wasn’t there for others. Apart from these issues, the participants were able to start the sign-up process successfully.
<br>
<br>
<strong>c) Forum</strong>
<br>
There are severe issues in the forum such as the topic-thread structure, which confused all participants with no exception, as well as a problematic Search function, which needs a review and possible re-development. Both mentioned issues caused disruption to the tasks as well as frustration to all the participants. Apart from those, the forum page also has navigation issues caused by both logical and technical mistakes. Alzheimer’s Society logo does not lead to the homepage when clicked. All users expected it to navigate to the home page and clicked that first multiple times when they were asked to navigate back to home page from the Forum.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4-Findability of Information</strong>
<br>
<br>
The issues mentioned above in the “Home Page” and Overall UX” sections also contribute to the difficulty of accessing information on the website, which was clearly observed during the final task of “finding resources for a carer”, where participants missed substantial amount of important information because the labelling and the placement of sections were not logical. Only 2 out of 5 participants could locate the “Guide for Carers”.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Reaction Box Findings and Analysis with Word Cloud</strong>
<br>
<br>
The word cloud was designed with the data from the Reaction Box activity (Microsoft Desirability Toolkit). 50 words were chosen from the Microsoft toolkit and the activity was presented to the user as a personalised reaction box.
<br>
This method was used to see the emotional response by the participant and the perceived desirability of the website.

<strong>Findings Summary</strong>
<br>
<br>
Despite all the difficulties in navigation overall, only one participant was not able to complete the task of finding the relevant section to engage with in the Forum. This failure was specifically significant in that this participant was the only one who used only the Search function in the Forum to try and find topics about dementia symptoms and diagnosis, unlike others who went to the threads straight away. His approach disclosed how malfunctioning the keyword-based search function is. It has no facets or filters to allow the user find information easily, bringing up a lot of irrelevant and outdated topics when he searched using various words and phrases. In the end, he spent quite a lot of time with it and in the end got frustrated and wanted to move on to another task.
Please see the Recommendations section for a closer look on the mentioned issues.

<h2>Recommendations</h2></div>

<div class="centerthetext">
<div class="flex-container1-text">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
<p class="blogtext">
In this section, 4 main recommendations are detailed. <em>(The website screenshot images were omitted in this section)
</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>OVERALL UX</strong>
<br>
<br>
1- Labelling of the global navigation is logical, however attention should be paid to the menu structure in general, grouping of the labels and the overcrowded sub-menu. Many of the sub-menu items do not need to be included in the home page, as long as the labelling is satisfactory. Eg. A user who wants to find information about Vascular dementia could click “Types of dementia” and access the relevant information. It does not need to be on this page. “More..” sections should also be removed as they contribute to the clutter in the menu, which may distract the user. The menu structure would benefit from an overall redesign with emphasis being on logical and clear placement and order.
<br>
<br>
2- Breadcrumbs should be used for navigation to avoid causing frustration for the user. Currently, users would struggle to navigate from one section to another due to poor links between sections. An effective navigation structure would allow the users to reach the information they need without frustration. Furthermore, none of the users thought of using the Search Bar at the top, its location may benefit from a review as well. Home Page Search functionality could be made more prominent to encourage the user. This would also benefit the forum section which has a similar issue with navigation, ie. a prominent search bar and facets to help user perform more than solely keyword search for efficient access to information and engagement on the forum.
<br>
<br>
3a- Donations
While donating in someone’s memory, entering their details should be optional and also should be placed at a later stage of the donation process.  the user should find this section at a later stage of the donation process. Some users might view this information as sensitive and and be put off by it, as mentioned by a few of the
participants during the sessions.
<br>
<br>
3b- Fundraising
Event pages should have more consistency. Some pages are much better designed, such as the ones with the “information box” where the user is able to see important information quickly without having to go through a chunk of text. The form can be shortened and laid out more efficiently by the prioritisation of the essential sections to be filled in, removing the non-essential parts and adding them to a different area if it is still critical information for the user. A more minimal form design may contribute to better engagement.
<br>
The blue information box in this screenshot from one of the events, mentioned in the ‘Findings’ section, was suggested as a good idea by all the participants since it displays important information quickly. While present in some of the events explored, it wasn’t there on some of the event pages, instead the participant needed to find this information within textual information. This, as well as the sign-up button’s not being present on all of the events’ main information pages were reported to be time-consuming and off-putting by the participants. Therefore, it is suggested that a specific template with the information box like below and the Sign-up button should be present on all the event pages.
<br>
<br>
3c- Forum
The forum’s Topic-Thread structure and visual representation of them should be redesigned to make sure that the user recognizes the topics and threads quickly. The limited search function also needs to be redeveloped to allow more detailed search of the forum. Please see the rainbow sheet in the Appendices for more details.
<br>
The logo on the top left, and Home and Forums tabs should be reviewed in terms of navigation. The logo should take the user the main home page/landing page, not the forum landing page. On the other hand, Home and Forums also link the user to the same page, which is the forum page. One suggestion could be to remove “Home” and only use “Forums” to navigate to the main forum page.
<br>
<br>
4- All information related to a specific topic, such as in our carers task example, should be placed in the same section of the website. Separating related sections into different parts of the website may lead to the users’ missing important information, further confusion and dissatisfaction with the quality and amount of the information while it is actually available on the website, but not easily findable.
<br>
As it can be clearly seen even from the titles only, About Dementia and Get Support sub sections contain related information and the participants expected related information to be in the same section.

<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
<br>
<br>
In all the sections of the website that were tested, various issued were found by the participants as detailed earlier in the report and the Appendices.
<br>
The content of the Alzheimer’s Society is very rich and useful as also emphasised by most of the participants, however, due to the issues in navigation, poor search functionality and problems and confusion arising from inconsistency found following the usability testing and the data analysed, it is clear that the website would benefit from redesign of key sections to increase the donations and help users complete the tasks by providing easy and clear navigation throughout the website.
<br>
<br>
By following the recommendations in the report, Alzheimer’s Society could see a significant improvement in their users’ experience and engagement with the website and content, which would also encourage people to donate more.
